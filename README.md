> **Projectional-editing?**
> 1. No parser needed: the user manipulates the AST directly (through projections)
> 2. Support of various notations: tables, math formulas, graphics...
> 3. Composition of any language without introducing syntactic ambiguities

## Worflow

1. **Language enginneer**
   1. Define a model for your DSL concepts or import and Ecore model
   2. Create projections to interact with your DSL concepts

2. **Domain expert**
   1. Use the generated editor to create the model instances
   2. Personnalize freely the presentation of your instance

## Features

- Platform agnostic: Gentleman target the web (no installation required)
- Support textual and tabular notations and multimedia content
- Offer specialized UI units for projection layout and fields
- Integration with Ecore: Define an Ecore model and use it with Gentleman projections

        <script src="gentleman.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create an instance in JS

```javascript
const MODEL = {JSON};
const PROJECTION = {JSON}

var editor = Gentleman.createEdiotr();
editor.init(MODEL, PROJETION)
```

# Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gentleman is currently in alpha.**

## Building the Code
